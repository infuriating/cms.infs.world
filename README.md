# cms.infs.world

This is a **Next.js** application built with **TypeScript**, **Convex** and **TailwindCSS**.

I run this application locally, so I can have a CMS for my personal website. I can add, edit and delete content from my website without having to touch the code or deploy the website.

As I have a separate deployment and development environment, I can make changes to the website without affecting the live version. I can preview the changes before deploying them.
